# Technical assignment full-stack engineer

Youâ€™re working on an online shopping platform. The sales team wants to know which items were added to a basket, but removed before checkout. We will use this data later for targeted discounts.

Build a shopping basket that helps you get this data. You are free to use the languages, frameworks and tools you prefer.

**Timing**

You have 1 week to accomplish the assignment. You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but one of our colleagues tends to say: "Make sure it is good" ;-). Please send us (jobs@madewithlove.com) an email when you are ready with the assignment. Please mention your name, Github username and a link to what we need to review.
